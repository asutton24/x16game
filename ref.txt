$7E/$7F is a data pointer
$7C/$7D is another swappable data pointer

entity format: type (0), sprite assignment (1), unused (for player holds current sprite) (2), x pos (3/4, fixed-point), y pos (5/6, fixed-point),
x vel (7/8, fixed-point), y vel (9/A, fixed-point), hitbox (B/C bytes, first is offset from top left in two 4-bit numbers,
second are the width and height of the box), health (D, high bit signifies invisibility, lower 7 are health points),
animation timer (E), current frame offset (F), number of frames (10), animation time (11), base frame (12), last byte is used for colliders
