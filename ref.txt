$7E/$7F is a data pointer
$7C/$7D is another swappable data pointer

entity format: type (1), sprite assignment (1), current sprite used (1), x pos (2, fixed-point), y pos (2, fixed-point),
x vel (2, fixed-point), y vel (2, fixed-point), hitbox (2 bytes, first is offset from top left in two 4-bit numbers,
second are the width and height of the box), health (high bit signifies invisibility, lower 7 are health points),
animation timer (1), animation time (1), number of frames (1), frame list (variable), whatever is left is free to use
